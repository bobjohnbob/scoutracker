I created this project because a) I always wished there was a better way to
track the progress of my CubScouts in getting their ranks and b) I wanted to
learn graphql with Apollo.

Right now there is a [demo](https://bobjohnbob.github.io/scouttracker/build/?id=cj54d5gqs6f4e0156y7x8tj0f) (unfortunately subscriptions with graph.cool seem to be somewhat unreliable, so it may not connect/update properly) where you can tick off achievements for a single scout's wolf adventures.  I've mostly built this project to learn graphql so I started there, there-fore it's not pretty (yet) but that is what I'll start working on next. Currently the demo is subscribing to live updates from a graph.cool generated API to know which achievements are checked off. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
